                          <description>One of DebConf’s recurring activities is the Key Signing Party. It helps Debian strengthen and expand its web of trust. This session will:

- Explain how keysigning is done in a DebConf setting
- Validate the SHA256 hash of the KSP coordination document
- Explain how to participate to people who did not send their keys in time

Once DebConf is closer, we will link from this talk proposal to the relevant documents you should have in hand for the keysigning party.</description>

                        <title>Software Heritage: building a community to safeguard the Software Commons</title>
                        
                        
                        
                          <description>Since its inception in 2015, [the Software Heritage project](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) has been [regularly archiving](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/) over 200 million Free Software projects. To date, this amounts to more than 15 billion unique source code files archived, over more than 3 billion individual commits, through [support for many version control systems](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/coverage/) (git, Mercurial, Breezy/Bazaar, Subversion, CVS), hosting platforms, and package managers (Debian, RPM, PyPI, NPM, Rubygems, CTAN, opam, Composer, Bower, and many more), all [developed as Free Software](https://gitlab.softwareheritage.org/) for all to see and contribute.

To sustain its growth, Software Heritage has had to evolve a lot, in terms of technical stack as well as in terms of organization, introducing a system of grants allowing third-party contributors to be paid to implement specific features in the archive, greatly improving our coverage and user-accessible features. We&#x27;re also in the final steps of building an initial network of mirrors of the archive, hosted by third-party organizations, increasing the resilience of the project.

During this talk, we will showcase the key features that the Software Heritage project offers to the community to help it safeguard the Software Commons: the archive itself, of course, [Save Code Now](https://save.softwareheritage.org/), [Add Forge Now](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/add-forge/request/list/), the Vault, the Deposit system, as well as [dataset exports](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-dataset/graph/dataset.html) and [compressed graph representation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9054827) both allowing the software mining and cybersecurity communities to do large-scale analysis over the whole Software Commons.

We will also lift the veil and show how the technical underpinnings of Software Heritage have evolved (or not) since we&#x27;ve [last presented it at DebConf](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/125/), showing [how we efficiently store dozens of billions of small files](https://wiki.softwareheritage.org/wiki/A_practical_approach_to_efficiently_store_100_billions_small_objects_in_Ceph), how we store a graph with hundreds of billions of edges to update it efficiently, and how we&#x27;re putting together working mirrors of all of this.</description>

                          <description>For open-source organizations, the community is a powerful tool. It helps to reach out to developers and other stakeholders vital for the project&#x27;s growth. The community enables public awareness, and it&#x27;s the spirit of the community that makes such projects successful and always updated. In this presentation, I will emphasize the best ways and tools you can use to adopt certain criteria and figure out the most efficient form to engage the stakeholders to drive the daily development and recurrent improvements of an open-source project.
Also, in this talk, I will be sharing strategies open-source projects can adopt to recruit diverse talent and bring about project visibility in under-represented demographics.</description>

                        <title>From 5 to 100: The Debian Brasília Community&#x27;s Story</title>
                        
                        
                        
                          <description>Building a local community is a challenging and time-consuming endeavor that requires dedication and effort. The Debian Brasília community, situated in the heart of Brazil, has made significant progress in this regard and we would like to share our achievements with the broader community.

In 2022, the members of Debian Brasília Community attended DebConf in Kosovo, which was a valuable opportunity for networking and knowledge exchange. During the Debian Brazil BoF session, it was decided that the Brasília community would host the 2023 Brazilian MiniDebConf. This event turned out to be a great success, the processes and tools developed by us can serve as inspiration for other local communities looking to grow.

Following the MiniDebConf Brasília 2023, we launched a mentorship program targeting the event attendees. A structured plan was developed to introduce mentees to the various tools used by the local community, and our progress was tracked using Salsa, our beloved Gitlab instance. Additionally, the community holds regular online meetings among participants and provide a platform for Q&amp;A sessions. These initiatives have proven instrumental in attracting new members and creating a supportive environment.

We are eager to share our experiences and knowledge with others, with the aim of helping local communities across the globe in their efforts to grow and thrive. By providing insights into our strategies and practices, we hope to inspire and support the development of vibrant communities in different regions.</description>

                          <description>Teams in Debian are somehow in flux.  In many teams it is not fully clear who is currently contributing or has moved to some other tasks while newcomers might be at the doorstep but have trouble to enter.  In teammetrics some numbers where gathered.  While these give some hints about the structure of a team, like how many people are effectively contributing and how good the workload is shared between the team members, it also enables interesting insight into the release process in general.
This talk tries to present some conclusion from the numbers I&#x27;ve drawn specifically for the teams I&#x27;m working in.  I will also discuss the problem, that in the freeze time before each release the overall activity will decrease.</description>

                          <description>This talk is intended for complete beginners. Even those unfamiliar to debian can attend it. This talk will emphasize what it means to package, why packaging is an important contribution and demonstrate the process of packaging using beginner friendly examples. I will first setup a debian sid environment for packaging and then demonstrate packaging examples in that environment. It can act as a video document for beginners to start learning debian packaging. The talk will also point to material on debian packaging for further reading and how to get involved with the community for contributing to packaging work.</description>

                        <title>State of Stateless - A Talk about Immutability and Reproducibility in Debian</title>
                        
                        
                        
                          <description>Debian is one of the most used Linux operating systems.
While RPM based OSes like Fedora, OpenSUSE are moving to
Transaction-Rollback style package management, the scenario in
Debian is still untouched.

In our talk, we explore and propose a user-perspective
view on how a transaction based system can be introduced in Debian.
We discuss about various technologies like layering of file system, taking
advantage of BTRFS, and snapshot algorithms etc.

We also shed light on the new trends in Linux ecosystem like Flatpak,
Nix, Guix and similar isolated package management systems.

Our talk is aimed at everyday users of Debian as the main motive
of Debian is to ensure stability, having a deterministic and reproducible
packages ensures that Debian systems can be deployed and used by users
with least technical knowledge. This also means that Debian can be used in
enterprise institutes with a stable base and fully-flexible changes to the 
packages in it. This can allow reduced-downtime updates of applications and services.

In short we have enhance Debian&#x27;s 007 principle. 0 stability issues, 0 security issues and 7000 reasons to use Debian.

We highly believe that this talk will act as a stepping stone in bringing up the 
features that shall enhance the traditional operating system metaphor.</description>

                          <description>Many people over the past decade have been working on making Debian [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org).

Despite that, work is still needed to reach our final goal of actually verifying the official Debian packages, and not just fully technical problems.

Also, despite our great success rate, there are still a few nasty reproducibility issues in ~4% of the tested packages from our test bed that are proving quite hard to get rid of.

In this talk, we&#x27;ll present these last blockers, and see what you can do to help us achieve full reproducibility!</description>

                          <description>In this talk, I would like to share how to construct a basic repository that allows your users to partially manage it with ease.

When I suggested utilizing Debian packaging for our CI dependencies, most of the developers declined due to a lack of understanding about Debian packaging. Considering that our image generation already took approximately an hour, I strongly felt the need to implement some form of packaging to reduce the time it takes to assemble containers.

I will discuss the utilization of CI to generate the packages, a Git repository for managing versioning (as we require reproducible package sets), and how to enable developers to easily update their software.</description>

                          <description>Research plays a major role now a days There are several open-source tools available for research across various disciplines. Here are some popular examples are  R and R Studio, Python and Jupyter Notebook , LaTeX, Git and GitHub and data,OpenCV, TensorFlow, Gephi,Zotero Orange, Node-red for IoT ,Cooja for IoT are few examples.  The choice of tools depends on your specific research needs and the field you are working in. I have to do hands on for the above open source tools for the Debian community.</description>

                          <description>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are fascinating astronomical phenomena thought to be 
caused by the collapse of massive stars or the merger of binary neutron stars. To gain 
insights into the distribution and properties of GRBs, we used open data GIS to map the 
distribution of GRBs in the sky. We collected data on GRBs from publicly available 
databases such as the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinate Network (GCN), the Gamma-Ray 
Burst Monitor (GBM), and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), and conducted spatial 
analysis to identify regions of the universe with high and low densities of GRBs. Our 
analysis revealed that GRBs are distributed non-uniformly in the sky, with a higher 
density of GRBs observed in certain regions of the universe. I identified several clusters 
of GRBs that were located near each other in space, suggesting that they may have a 
common origin. Our density maps showed that GRBs are most common in the outskirts 
of galaxies, where star formation is also high. These results suggest that the formation 
of GRBs is closely linked to the formation and evolution of stars in galaxies. My findings 
demonstrate the power of open data GIS in providing new insights into the distribution 
and properties of astronomical phenomena, and highlight the importance of open data 
sharing in advancing scientific research</description>

                          <description>Contributing to open-source projects can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, share, and build experience. There are plenty of reasons why you should contribute to an open-source project, such as: gaining new knowledge, making new friends from all around the world and sharing with others what you have learned. In my presentation, I will share with you my experience in the GNOME community as the program manager.


Main points of the presentations would be: 

* What’s our main focus in GNOME&#x27;s contribution areas
* How does the GNOME community work inside.
* What are the areas of contribution etc,</description>

                          <description>In an increasingly digital world where we are virtually accessing all of our rights, it is important to understand the transition of the transfer of power and rights. Privacy, Access, and Free Speech are basic rights that need to be available in our digital realm. They are also ideas that need to be reflected by design in product choices. 

This talk will focus on sensitizing the general audience to why we need these values to be refected in our tech designs and decisions. This exercise can act as a sensitization exercise to the audience at large.</description>

                        <title>Sustainable solutions for self-hosting</title>
                        
                        
                        
                          <description>It is a nontechnical talk and aimed at a general audience. 

The main ideas I will present are:
why self hosting is required, 
individual vs collective self hosting,
collective self hosting and collective control over Free Software projects can give people outside the technical community a way to modify the software, a freedom granted by Free/Libre Software but usually available only to developers or big companies. 

Self-hosting has become an attractive idea for people who like control of services and their data into their own hands. It also helps us challenge big tech and their monopolies on respective parts of internet. But self-hosting consumes time and resources, and requires a lot of skill. Privacy is a fundamental right and should be easily exercised by anyone. Individual self-hosting will only allow people with knowledge, skill and time to gain privacy and control over the services they use. 

In this talk, I will introduce ideas for sustainable self-hosting. I will make a case for community based self hosted services in exchange for voluntary donations as much more resilient than individual self-hosting. Usually the decisions by community-backed services are based on consensus, rather than one person dictating all the terms.  

I will also mention prav project which is an attempt to run an XMPP based chat service by a cooperative society in India, and plans to be funded directly by the users. This way the prav app can be modified by nontechnical people as they are also included in the decision-making.</description>

                          <description>Although Debian has just turned 30, in my experience it has not yet fully turned adult: we sometimes squabble like boys in puberty, like children we assume that someone takes care of paying the bills and bringing out the trash, we procrastinate on our responsibilities and hope nobody notices.

At the same time, we cannot assume that people have the energy and motivation to do what is needed to keep the house clean and the boat afloat: Debian is based on people volunteering, and people have diverse and changing reasons to be with us, and private lives, loved ones and families, bills to be paid.

I want to start figuring out how to address practical issues around the sustainability of the Debian community, in a way that fits the needs and peculiarities of the Debian community.

The end does not justify the means: really, the means define what the end will be. I want to talk about the means: how to be sustainable, how to be interesting, how to be fun, how to have a community worth caring for, how to last for centuries</description>

                          <description>Netplan is a utility for network configuration on Linux systems. You create a description of the required interfaces and define how each should be set up.

It meets the need for easy, declarative network configuration in YAML across a versatile set of server, desktop, cloud or IoT installations.

It is useful for administrators of Linux systems who want to use a common network configuration, controlling different backends like NetworkManager or systemd-networkd.</description>

                          <description>We will look at ZFS it’s capabilities and use cases, along with its stable Debian port.

Majorly focusing on features like: compression, encryption, snapshots, caching and data integrity checks &amp; error corrections on RAID with high performance for use cases like NAS (network attached storage).


this will be useful for anyone who want to explore ZFS on Debian.</description>

                          <description>Many FOSS projects that were started a long time ago still follow a mailing list based development model. Patches are sent via email, bug-tracking is done via a separate platform and there is no or little continuous integration. While in some cases it might be because of the maintainers&#x27; preference to the old ways, in other cases it might be because no one is willing to take the charge of such a migration

One such project was FreeType. I proposed, coordinated and performed the project&#x27;s migration to the gitlab instance hosted by freedesktop.org in 2021. This included discussing with the community about their concerns, requirements, preferences and then deciding the roadmap. Then I had to write scripts to scrape the FreeType&#x27;s bug reports on savannah and migrate them to gitlab. I also participated in discussions about the merge request workflow

I also helped in setting up a continuous integration environment and help manage the docker images.

After migrating freetype&#x27;s repo to gitlab, I also helped in migrating its website freetype.org&#x27;s hosting to gitlab pages and setting up a CI for auto-deployment. In fact the website repo stored FreeType&#x27;s API reference documentation in its source tree while it could be generated in a CI environment. I proposed and implemented a change such that it would automatically generate and deploy the API reference webpages, leading to an MR that removed over 90k (ninety thousand) lines of code from the freetype-web repo.

My talk will be about the benefits of migrating to gitlab/github, importance of discussion in community, challenges I faced during the migration, how it impacted the number of contributions received by the project and other related things.

For projects using savannah as their bug-tracker they will gain knowledge on how to migrate theor bug reports to gitlab. For contributors of other FOSS projects they will gain the perspective on how to propose and co-ordinate a drastic change to a project&#x27;s workflow. I will also talk about the added benefits that come from using gitlab/github based workflow.</description>

                          <description>In this BoF we want to smoothen the communication process between ftpmaster and developers.  The extremely important job of ftpmaster is done by a quite small team.  There were some discussions in the past how the process to accept software to the archive might be simplified.  There was some attempt to summarise these discussions in the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/FTPMaster/CommunityGuidelines).
The items raised on this Wiki page can be discussed, clarified and enhanced with the goal to simplify the work of the members of the ftpmaster team and to reflect the wishes and needs of the Debian community.
I hope many members of the ftpmaster team will either join physically or online.</description>

                          <description>This workshop is for newcomers who want to learn packaging their very own example of Free Software.  Please bring a laptop and a link to some Free Software you want to see packaged for Debian.  I will pick one of the examples from the audience that seems to be bearable to deal with in 2h (+x) and I will demonstrate how I would tackle the packaging.  This workshop lives from spotting problems in packaging and show how these problems can be solved by working together with the community.</description>

VGLUG FOUNDATION is an active FOSS community which is working for a decade to spread the FOSS technologies among the gross roots of the country. For the past 10 years, community have provided the huge amount of contributions to various open source softwares and open source communities such as Wikimedia, Firefox, KDE, Debian etc., and also empowered the rural people with FOSS and helped them to get rid of their poverty. 

VGLUG FOUNDATION have initiated a Support group for Debian. We are training the students from rural background with in and out of Debian and making them as support engineers for Debian operating system.</description>

                          <description>Organizing every year the participation of [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as mentoring organization in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) and mentoring contributors for [OpenPrinting](http://www.openprinting.org/) I work together with Aveek Basu who joined OpenPrinting when he worked at Lexmark in India. He is reaching out to colleges and universities in India and this way we have every year around 5-7 students as contributors for OpenPrinting, most studying at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Mandi.

With the DebConf being in India, Aveek and me have decided to meet most of our current and former contributors in-person and motivate the students, professors, researchers to join the community of developers, designers, doc writers, ... in a 2-1/2-day conference, the &quot;[Opportunity Open Source](https://events.canonical.com/e/mandi2023)&quot;. We will talk with them about their GSoC experience on a panel, have a GSoC Q&amp;A session, and the contributors presenting their work. By a Call for Proposals we hope to get a wide range of more contributions. And for attendees getting some real-life experience we are running this year&#x27;s OpenPrinting Roadmap Sprint on the conference and attendees can participate in the discussion and planning of the next 12 months in printing and scanning. We will also live-stream and record everything and allow remote participation.

The conference takes place on September 8-10, right before the DebConf.

This talk is about how we have organized the conference, the challenges, and naturally also the outcome and experiences with running it, having come right from there to the DebConf. And we will have a Q&amp;A session about organizing conferences and also being a mentoring organization for the Google Summer of Code.

So everyone interested in running a free software conference and/or participating in the Google Summer of Code is welcome to participate in this session.</description>

                          <description>Stefano has been working on [a web application](https://salsa.debian.org/stefanor/debian-reimbursement/) to track planned expenses and reimbursements for the Debian project (and similar organizations).

This is planned to replace RT-based workflows and centralize requests against all TOs in one place. We hope to use it for the first time, for some of the DebConf 23 expense reimbursements.

This session will be a brief demo of the application, its features, and the roadmap ahead. Feedback and contributors are welcome!

[Freexian](https://freexian.com/) has [been funding Stefano&#x27;s work](https://salsa.debian.org/freexian-team/project-funding/-/blob/master/accepted/2022-11-debian-reimbursements.md), and the Debian Treasurer team has been reviewing and giving feedback.</description>

                          <description>In the digital era of knowledge systems and governance, there are still many villages that don&#x27;t have any phone network, no internet and no digital footprints of any type. We have hundreds of such villages in Andhra Pradesh, India. We made an attempt to provide them with a digital radio, library, and calling facility and media center with the help of freedombox. The youth in the villages own this set up and form a community around this to sustain this successfully. The story we want to share is how we hacked the freedombox to create the use cases that impacted the public domain and how we are planning to spread this across the state. 

Despite commendable progress in technology, significant gaps persist, particularly in rural areas where access to the internet remains limited. This talk will share our experience in setting up community networks in rural India with limited to zero mobile network connectivity by using Debian, Freedom Box, Free software and Network Equipment. Our initiative aims to provide internet access and essential self-hosted services for small communities for communication, data access, knowledge systems, media streaming etc.  We will discuss the creation and deployment of our digital knowledge repository through Freedom Box. 

By leveraging its capabilities, we have enabled various services such as village radio/broadcasting, streaming, access to books and libraries, voice calls, etc. This talk will also focus on the community aspect of it. By embracing the principles of decentralization, we have established a robust and reliable network infrastructure that serves the unique needs of each community and fostered a sense of ownership and collaboration among the community members, enabling them to actively participate in building and maintaining their network infrastructure and have full control of the services and content suiting to the needs of their community. To provide real-world examples of the impact of our work, we will present a few case studies.

Our audience could be anyone who wishes to leverage Free Software for Social Impact, enabling communities, working to bridge the digital divide, looking forward to establish knowledge commons, a person who wishes to see how Free Software can impact lives of the commons. It could be a Debian contributor who would get to know about the impact their contributions are having in the real world, or an enthusiast who is looking for ideas.</description>

                          <description>There was a time when we were proud to get _this many people_ from _this many countries_ in a conference. Nowadays, even if still amazed about what can be accomplished face-to-face, many of us have mixed feelings regarding our carbon footprint and other many of us refuse to take part in any meeting that involves air travel.

If we are not ready to give up global international meetings altogether, maybe it is time to bring about change in the way we run conferences in order to diminish our impact. Business as usual does not help, and it is clear it adds to the pot!

In this session we will discuss some alternative actions, and with your help, maybe this could lead to a draft recommendation for future Debian meetings.

_Note: If you won&#x27;t be there and want your ideas to be taken into account, please get in touch by email, and we&#x27;ll do our best to raise your voice in the session._</description>

                          <description>[Salsa CI](https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/) provides an automated framework to build and run common test of debian packages *before* uploading to the archive. It has become widely used inside Debian, and forked to other distributions and projects.

This BoF would aim at gathering Debian fellows interested on CI. Talk about the current status, new features, how it can be improved, and so on.</description>

                          <description>Have you ever wondered what to do with a spare laptop or any other unused device? I certainly have. So, I embarked on a research journey to explore how I could repurpose my laptop as a server, with a focus on enhancing security and minimizing vulnerabilities. While it&#x27;s important to note that no system is entirely invulnerable, some are certainly more secure than others.

My exploration led me to self-hosted VPN solutions, which allowed me to connect my home laptop with its 10 GB of RAM and 3 TB of storage to a less powerful server with 1 GB of RAM and 50 GB of storage. This setup provided the foundation for my server&#x27;s operation, ranging from basic to high-performance specifications. Setting everything up took some time and effort.

In a nutshell, I established a VPN connection between my home laptop and the server, ensuring they were on the same network. Next, I implemented an encrypted secure tunnel using WireGuard. Additionally, I set up a reverse proxy on my server, enabling all requests to pass through it and reach my home server securely.

During my talk, I will delve into the details of this process and explain each step thoroughly.</description>

                          <description>TuxMake, is a command line tool and Python library that provides portable and repeatable Linux kernel builds across a variety of architectures, toolchains, kernel configurations, and make targets. TuxMake is a part of TuxSuite, a suite of tools and services to help with Linux kernel development.

This talk will explore the usage of Debian within the TuxMake project and the multiple architecture support which Debian provides, which in turn makes it possible to build a system like TuxMake.

**Audience:** This talk is intended for developers who are interested in building Linux kernel for more than one architecture (cross compile) with ease. It will showcase how Debian&#x27;s multi-architecture support helps in creating containers with necessary tooling for cross compilation.

**Goals:**

 1. Learn to use TuxMake for Linux kernel builds in Debian
 1. Cross compile Linux kernel with multiple architecture
 1. Avoid complex installation and managing of cross compilation tools within a developer box

**Outline:**

 1. Introduction to TuxMake
 1. TuxMake internals with Debian containers
 1. Installation and usage of TuxMake
 1. Portable and repeatable builds with TuxMake
 1. TuxMake on the cloud for large scale build automation (TuxSuite)</description>

                          <description>The /usr-merge still is an unfinished transition. Finishing it proves to be a difficult problem. A debian-devel@lists.debian.org discussion has captured the relevant sub-problems and gathered some consensus on a way forward. Helmut will give a short update on the state of affairs and then we&#x27;ll move into discussion. Attendees are asked to read [DEP17](https://subdivi.de/~helmut/dep17.html) ahead of time in order to use time for questions effectively.</description>

                          <description>My experience with homelabing and free software. Adding up servers from freenas then pfsense and then using proxmox as hypervisor for services. 

From figuring out which hardware to buy to price, feature and power consumption and feature upgrade path. Then choosing which OS to use for file server then a firewall for the network OpenWrt and pfSense then and adding a hypervisor to set up and experiment with VMs and containers at home using free software. 

Will explain the shortcoming and plus points of the services as I discovered in the journey...</description>

                          <description>Most off-the-shelf home automation hardware products run proprietary software. We usually purchase them for the additional convenience they might provide us.

However, its very possible to do control our lights, switches, networks, music and much more using Free Software exclusively.

As a part of this workshop, I will offer a practical hands-on demonstration of running a wide variety of devices that can be used in a typical home network using Free Software.

This includes:

1. A home server using Yunohost &amp; Home Assistant (on Debian)
2. A wireless router using OpenWRT
3. Off-the-shelf tube-lights flashed with free software firmware (Tasmota)
4. Electrical switches with Tasmota &amp; Espurna firmware
5. Monitoring power consumption
6. Building colourful lights using WLED
7. Integrating self-hosted voice assistants like Mycroft with Home Assitant
8. Integrating and bridging communications systems: Matrix, XMPP and more.

I will setup a network with all these hardware and walk the participants into how to integrate and use them.

My hope is that via this workshop some people will want to build such a &quot;playground&quot; for themselves. And that will encourage more activity into integrating these tools better with Debian so that they&#x27;re easier for others to use.</description>

                          <description>This talk is for anyone who is interested in understanding the process behind designing assets for a diverse project like Debian. Designing for a technical crowd presents its own set of challenges. In this talk, I go over my journey of navigating the intricacies of capturing developers&#x27; attention while preserving the event&#x27;s essence. 

The talk goes through the following points:

- Importance of good design.

- Designing for free software developers.

- Design with free software.

- Designing for Debian.

- State of the design in Debian.

- Designing for DebConf.

- Building a culture of good design in Debian.</description>

                          <description>This is a call to people interested on live coding (to produce sound and visuals) to meet and discuss the topic Live Coding on Debian. This is the 2nd BoF on this topic, last year we have done the 1st BoF at DebConf22, and now we would like to advance on this topic to bring more people interested on Live Coding and people interested on collaboration to improve Live Coding tools on Debian.</description>

                          <description>Debian Installer is a very complex project with many parts. In a sense, it is an almost-independent OS that is being maintained by the installer team inside the Debian archive. Its  code organization, build processes, compile-time and run-time modularity, user interfaces, translations, the install process itself... Every piece involved has its own idiosyncrasies due to its age and the constraints under which it was designed to work.

It&#x27;s a marvel, but it&#x27;s showing its age. There&#x27;s a massive learning curve of understanding the existing legacy, and the requirement to not break it. There&#x27;s the issue of not having enough developer time and attention for development, let alone reviewing others&#x27; work and mentoring them. As a result, it appears that most often things move very slowly if they do at all.

I think the current state isn&#x27;t really sustainable, and that bringing more Developer attention to the installer is the key to avoid it being frozen in time. So, in this talk I&#x27;ll try to explain how everything related to the installer is connected together, and guide you through the process of how to work on it.</description>

                          <description>My talk explains the process and the results from a usability test of the Debian installer. The goal of this test was to find out how usable the installer is for a variety of users with different levels of experience. In the report, we compared the installation process with other popular distributions such as Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and Fedora. We aimed to use the results of the study to establish in what ways the Debian installer as well as related Debian documentation could be improved to give users a better experience.

This talk covers the different sections of installing Debian, such as, downloading the ISO, the steps to verify it, flashing a USB key, and the actual process of installation that follows. It also uncovers the different challenges encountered by users.</description>

                        <title>Gomti: A collection of PLL-based True RNG on FPGA</title>
                        
                        
                        
                          <description>Gomti [0] is a collection of PLL-based True Random Number Generator.
Currently, we have implementations for FPGA: ice40 HX8K and Gowin GW1NR-9/C.
With Gomti, we can build a good USB TRNG device, for example, using
TEC0117 board.

In 2013, I released NeuG 1.0 [1], an implementation of TRNG on
STM32F103, based on the sampling noise of ADC.  It has been useful in
the situation where no good noise source is available.  I had an
presentation in Debconf15 [2].  While it is empirically useful, it
lacks mathematical or physical model.

Around 2015, there were projects like OneRNG [3] and ChaosKey [4]
which is based on diode noise source.

In 2022, I sought around TRNG technology again, with following
constraints:

* Easier to implement (cost-wise, technology-wise)
* Patent free
* Better reproducibility
* Build-able with common parts
* Build-able with free tool (as in freedom)

Given the situation we have a good free tool for FPGA (Yosys and
nextpnr [5]), I realized that PLL-based TRNG can be built fulfilling
the constraints above, reading papers of [6], [7], and [8].

People who have an interest around hardware development and FPGA can
enjoy Gomti to build their own USB TRNG device.  Security geeks may find a
practical and interesting source of entropy.

Let us discuss about reproducible and transparent random number
generation.

                          <description>The RISC-V ISA specification PDFs are sometimes not so friendly to beginners, and retrieving specific transversal information is at times a bit cumbersome. We introduce a solution: the &quot;Sliderules&quot; Cheatsheets, which is an ultra-beginner friendly source of detailed documentation about the RISC-V ISA. Thanks to a careful 2D layout and alignment of the ISA information, hence the name &quot;Sliderules&quot;, the original RV32IMAC static cheatsheets were designed with the idea of making students &quot;play&quot; an assembler, enabling them to quickly convert assembly to binary and back. Unfortunately, the original RV32IMAC project is not version controlled and particularly human-error-prone, and thus difficult to maintain: thanks to an ongoing LFX/RISC-V Mentorship program, the project is currently in the process of being ported to the web as an interactive application, while also being expanded to RV64GC.</description>

                          <description>The Linux kernel has a very active development community, constantly adding not only new hardware support but new features. Some of these features can simply be enabled by the configuration in the Debian package, but some also require support from other user-space packages. This talk will cover some of the more interesting changes made in the past year, and any work that’s still needed to support these in Debian.</description>

                          <description>This is the annual Debian Ruby team BoF. This is time we would gather together to discuss the work we’ve done so far and the work that needs to be done.

Besides that, this meeting will be used to discuss other activities that are going on within the team, like new workflows, what’s working and what’s not, and etcetera.

And lastly, we’d decide the logistics of the next possible sprints :)</description>

                          <description>Creating a Debian mirror can be a relatively straightforward process. All you need is a physical server or virtual machine (VM) with ample storage capacity. By configuring the ftp-sync script on this server to retrieve data from your chosen mirror and architecture, and setting up cronjobs for regular updates, you can easily serve the mirror&#x27;s content using your preferred web or FTP server.

But why stop at simplicity? Let&#x27;s explore the possibilities of adding Kubernetes to the mix and taking the setup to the next level.

In this presentation, we will discuss a proof of concept (POC) that demonstrates how to integrate Kubernetes into the Debian mirror setup. By leveraging the power and flexibility of Kubernetes, we can enhance the scalability, resilience, and manageability of the mirror infrastructure.</description>

                          <description>Siemens and other companies heavily rely on Debian for a wide range of products. To streamline the process of building and maintaining images for these products, we utilize a tool called Isar. Isar allows for the use of Debian binary packages and facilitates creation of custom packages from source, providing a unique combination of stability and customization.

By leveraging Debian&#x27;s robustness, security fixes and updates, product builders benefit from a solid foundation. At the same time, Isar offers the flexibility to tailor solutions to specific requirements, such as building custom kernels or including patches that are not yet upstream.

During this session, we will introduce Isar and showcase its advantages through successful projects that have embraced its capabilities. We will demonstrate how this approach scales effectively by using layers that abstract common bases across products. Furthermore, we will highlight the improved Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines achieved by leveraging the new caching capabilities of Isar, enabling the rapid building of complete bootable images for various architectures within minutes.</description>

                          <description>Bring your laptop and let&#x27;s tinker on the Debian Installer together!

I intend this workshop to be one where you can start working on the installer with a small project, and ask me for help if you get stuck. I think doing small projects on subjects you are interested in is a very effective way to learn. The installer has a workable user interface that can ask different types of questions, so the most obvious idea I could think of is to turn it into a text adventure game.

But there&#x27;s a lot of other things you might want to do with the installer instead -- that&#x27;s the real adventure. Think of something you&#x27;d like the installer to do and try implementing it!</description>

                        <title>Intro to SecureDrop, a sort-of Linux distro</title>
                        
                        
                        
                          <description>[SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/) is an open source whistleblower submission system built on top of Ubuntu/Debian/Tails. Originally created by the late Aaron Swartz, it&#x27;s now managed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation and deployed in newsrooms across the globe.

This talk will give an overview of the SecureDrop project, starting with the unique attributes like mandatory self-hosting, minimal metdata retention and encryption at rest. We&#x27;ll especially cover the interactions with Debian, including our struggles and successes with reproducible builds and (ab)uses of Debian packaging for our own benefit. Then we can examine at how it&#x27;s sort-of a Linux distro in that we manage our own kernel, installer, APT repos, etc., but don&#x27;t have the full infrastructure that proper distros do (e.g. no ISOs) and the pros and cons of adopting such an approach.

Finally we&#x27;ll look at where the project is headed in the future, including the SecureDrop Workstation project built on top of Qubes OS and Debian and next-generation server setup.

The intended audience is Debian contributors and other open source developers. Debian contributors should leave with a better understanding how Debian is used to build open source platforms that contribute to the public good. The audience should also have a sense of where the project is going and what potential contribution opportunities exist.</description>

                          <description>This talk will focus on using Free Software to fight against digital authoritarianism. We live in a world where digital rights are slowly becoming human rights. 
There are tools which are needed to fight against this quick takeover of our digital lives. Example of this is the open-source website internetshutdowns.in which was created as an open-source tool and is perhaps the only real-time tracker of Internet shutdowns in the world. During COVID we saw, many governments coming up with contact tracking apps that would steal the data of citizens without any privacy-protecting ways. Open source mandates can really work to counter these.</description>

                        <title>The New Architecture for Printing and Scanning on Debian</title>
                        
                        
                        
                          <description>With the background of all modern printers being driverless IPP printers (self-advertising network printers, AirPrint, Mopria, IPP Everywhere ...) and the standard job format being PDF and not PostScript any more for years we will have changes in the architecture of the printing stack.

From the [3.x series](https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/liaison/openprinting/presentations/cups-plenary-may-2023.pdf) on ([release end-2024](https://openprinting.github.io/OpenPrinting-News-May-2023/#cups-3x-release-postponed)) [CUPS](https://openprinting.github.io/cups/) will not support classic printer drivers consisting of PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files and filter executables any more but go totally IPP (Internet Printing Protocol), supporting only driverless IPP printers. To not drop support for legacy printers the drivers are now provided as [Printer Applications](https://openprinting.github.io/current/#printer-applications), software emulators of IPP printers.

As many driverless IPP printers are multi-function devices with a built-in scanner, we got also standards for driverless scanning, via IPP itself or via eSCL, making the scanners in such printers also just work and especially give us the possibility to have Printer Applications support the full multi-function devices or even create Scanner Applications as new format of distributing scanner drivers.

And this also has impact on the desktop user interfaces, printer setup tools and print dialogs, as we do not have permanent CUPS queues with driver filter and PPD any more but instead, IPP print services for which CUPS auto-creates a temporary queue on demand. So we list IPP services and not queues now and printer setup tools find and install Printer Applications and lead us to the web admin interfaces of the IPP services.

In this talk an introduction to the New Architecture is given and how it affects the Debian distribution, especially also printer setup tools and print dialogs and also the differences between the Debian distribution only containing Debian packages and the Ubuntu distribution (23.10+) using the [Snaps](https://snapcraft.io/publisher/openprinting) of CUPS and the Printer Applications.

This way right after the Bookworm release and in the beginning of the new cycle the Debian developer community will be informed about all printing- and scanning-related changes which have to get taken into account.

And right before this DebConf, on the [Opportunity Open Source](https://events.canonical.com/e/mandi2023) in the IIT Mandi, on September 8, we will have the [OpenPrinting Roadmap Sprint 2023](https://events.canonical.com/event/35/program) where we are planning our work for the next 12 months. The outcomes will be covered by this talk, too.

                          <description>Proxmox VE is built upon Debian and is a complete, open-source server management platform for enterprise virtualization. It tightly integrates the KVM hypervisor and Linux Containers (LXC), software-defined storage and networking functionality, on a single platform. With the integrated web-based user interface you can manage VMs and containers, and so on with ease.

We will get familiar with Proxmox VE, its Pros and Cons, and use cases in home lab and beyond.


This is useful for anyone who want to dive into world of homelabs, self-host VMs, Data Centers and management of these all.</description>

                          <description>Since the emergence of the modern containers idea, Docker has been the go-to technology to many users, not just to run and manage containers, but also to build images, share them, and manage the entire lifecycle of container instances. Docker has become an important tool in the daily work of developers, sysadmins and DevOps engineers. Many of those users have been using third-party Docker packages instead of using the packages we provide in Debian. Analyzing this situation and understanding where we can improve is key to keep Debian relevant for them.

We, as the Debian community, need to always try to provide what our users are in need. Are we providing everything needed by our users considering the Docker ecosystem? Is there a way to improve the Docker user experience? In this talk, we are going to present the work that has been done so far, some problems, and discuss what we could do to keep improving this ecosystem in Debian.</description>

                          <description>The last few years saw the rise/rebirth of &quot;Linux on Mobile&quot;, that is devices capable of running (close to) mainline Linux kernels and userspace applications that you are familiar with from your desktops, laptops and servers. This talk will include a brief history, an overview of available hardware options as well as talk about (Debian based) distributions and the overall software ecosystem.

I will examine some of the available hardware and software options and spotlight the Debian based distributions that exist today. This talk should help you answer the eternal question of &quot;Is it daily driveable?&quot; for yourself. To achieve that I will share my experiences relying on these sort of devices during the last three years. My phone(s) run(s) [phosh](https://phosh.mobi), a touch-friendly graphical shell for mobile devices built around GNOME technologies, on the Debian based systems [PureOS](https://pureos.net/) and [Mobian](https://mobian.org)</description>

                          <description>Session to discuss possible locations for DebConf25!

We have no official bids for DebConf25, yet.

If you&#x27;re interested in hosting DebConf in your city, this is the time to come and present your ideas. They don&#x27;t need to be fully fleshed out, but the more detail you have, the more useful discussion we can have.</description>

                          <description>We have the fine tradition of having DebConf N share their experiences with DebConf N+1. The DebConf committee will also be present and we invite a core member of every team to come around and help with the knowledge transfer.
